# Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

**Purpose:** An offline, CPU-only engine that analyzes a collection of PDF documents to extract the most relevant sections based on a user persona and a specific task.

**Core Features:**
* **Automated Setup:** The required machine learning model is automatically downloaded during the Docker build.
* **Parallel Processing:** Uses Python's `multiprocessing` to analyze multiple documents simultaneously for high throughput.
* **Intelligent Sectioning:** Employs advanced heuristics to identify and remove document noise (headers/footers) and accurately segment content.
* **Hybrid Scoring:** Combines keyword density and semantic similarity search to rank sections with high accuracy.
* **Optimized & Offline:** The entire system is packaged in a self-contained Docker image with no network dependency at runtime.

## Project Structure

The engine processes collections organized in the following structure. The `challenge1b_output.json` files are generated by the script in their respective collection directories.

Challenge_1b/
├── Collection 1/
│   ├── PDFs/
│   ├── challenge1b_input.json
│   └── challenge1b_output.json
├── ...
└── (Project Files)

## Build & Run

1.  **Build the Docker Image**
    * The build process will automatically download the necessary model (approx. 80MB).

    ```bash
    docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t coredump:round1b .
    ```

2.  **Run the Analysis**
    * This command runs the analysis on all collections found in the project directory. It runs completely offline.

    ```bash
    docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/app/data --network none coredump:round1b
    ```
